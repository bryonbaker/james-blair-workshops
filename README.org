#+TITLE: OpenShift Application Delivery Workshop
#+AUTHOR: James Blair
#+DATE: <2023-12-04 Mon>

This repository contains a basic [[https://nextjs.org/][nextjs]] frontend designed to be exported as a static site and served via [[https://pages.github.com/][github pages]].

The frontend contains a walkthrough for workshop designed to be run over three hours covering basic application delivery, monitoring and security on OpenShift. The workshop content is tailored towards participants that are new to containers and kubernetes and will not be developing applications but will instead be expected to deliver existing applications onto OpenShift.


** Local development

To set up a local development environment run the following:

#+begin_src bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and serve the site
npm run build && npm run serve
#+end_src


** Exporting static site

To export the site to static html to serve for example via github pages, run:

#+begin_src bash
