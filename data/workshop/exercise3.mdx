We have our application deployed, let's scale it up.

While **Services** provide routing and load balancing for **Pods**, the higher level **Deployment** resource specifies how many replicas of our application will be created and is a simplistic way to configure scaling for the application.

> Note: To learn more about **Deployments** refer to this [documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.html).


## 3.1 - Reviewing the parksmap deployment

Let's start by confirming how many `replicas` we currently specify for our ParksMap application. We'll also use this exercise step to take a look at how all resources within OpenShift can be viewed and managed as [YAML](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) formatted text files which is extremely useful for more advanced automation and GitOps concepts. 

Start in the **Topology** view of the **Developer** perspective.

Click on your "Parksmap" application icon and click on the **D parksmap** deployment name at the top of the right hand panel.

From the **Deployment details** view we can click on the **YAML** tab and scroll down to find the following:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 1
```
