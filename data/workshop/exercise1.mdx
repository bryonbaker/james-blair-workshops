Red Hat [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a unified platform to build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale. In this first excercise we'll get logged into our cluster and familarise ourselves with the OpenShift web console and web terminal.

The OpenShift Container Platform web console is a feature-rich user interface with both an **Administrator** perspective and a **Developer** perspective accessible through any modern web browser. You can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage your OpenShift cluster and the applications running on it.

In addition to the web console, OpenShift includes command line tools to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the platform. The `oc` command line tool is available for Linux, macOS or Windows.

**Let's get started!**
