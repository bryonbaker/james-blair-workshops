Red Hat [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a unified platform to build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale. In this first excercise we'll get logged into our cluster and familarise ourselves with the OpenShift web console.

The OpenShift Container Platform web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser. You can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage your OpenShift cluster and the applications running on it.

Let's get started!

## 1.1 - Login to lab environment

An OpenShift `4.14` cluster has already been provisioned for you to complete these excercises. Open your web browser and navigate to the workshop login page https://demo.redhat.com/workshop/vq5abz.

Once the page loads you can login with the details provided by your workshop facilitator.

## 1.2 - Login to the cluster console

Once you're logged into the lab environnment we can open up the OpenShift web console and login with the credentials provided. 

The cluster console has a menu on the left to quickly access categories such as `Storage`, `Networking` or `Workloads`. We'll dive into these sections in more detail shortly.
