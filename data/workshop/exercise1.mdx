Red Hat [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a unified platform to build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale. In this first excercise we'll get logged into our cluster and familarise ourselves with the OpenShift web console.

The OpenShift Container Platform web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser. You can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage your OpenShift cluster and the applications running on it.

Let's get started!
