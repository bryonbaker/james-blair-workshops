summary: "Will OpenShift Virtualisation live migrate a virtual machine?"
---

During the demo with the Acme Financial Services team one of their traditional hypervisor team asked if you can show them a live migration for a running virtual machine.

Thinking on your feet you remember the Fedora virtual machine you've were tinkering with last night in the `demotestblah17` namespace on the cluster.

The Acme Financial Services team have put you on the spot, can you quickly pull off a virtual machine live migration? ðŸ˜…


## 2.1 - Confirm the machine current state

...

## 2.2 - Initiate the live migration

...

## 2.3 - Confirm the workload is uninterrupted

...

## 2.4 - Check your work

If the virtual machine in your **demotestblah17** namespace has been live migrated successfully please post a message in `#rh-hackathon-ocp-virt` with the message:

> Please review team [name] solution for exercise 3.

This exercise is worth 25 points. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total score.
