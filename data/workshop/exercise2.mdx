In this first hands on excercise we will prepare our cluster for running Windows nodes by installing an operator and configuring it.

[Operators](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/operators/index.html) are among the most important components of OpenShift Container Platform. Operators are the preferred method of packaging, deploying, and managing additional cluster services or application.

To install Operators on OpenShift we use Operator Hub. A simplistic way of thinking about Operator Hub is as the "App Store" for your OpenShift cluster.

## 2.1 - Enable hybrid networking

As a cluster administrator, you can configure a Red Hat OpenShift cluster network to allow Linux and Windows nodes to host Linux and Windows workloads, respectively.

This requires enabling a feature called **[hybrid networking](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-hybrid-networking.html#configuring-hybrid-ovnkubernetes)**.

To configure hybrid networking, run the following command in your bastion host terminal:

```bash
oc patch networks.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  -p '{
    "spec":{
      "defaultNetwork":{
        "ovnKubernetesConfig":{
          "hybridOverlayConfig":{
            "hybridClusterNetwork":[
              {
                "cidr": "10.132.0.0/14",
                "hostPrefix": 23
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```


## 2.2 - Install the windows machine config operator

If you have a running OpenShift cluster, you can install the optional **Windows Machine Config Operator** to configure Windows machines into nodes, enabling Windows container workloads to be ran within your OpenShift cluster. 

Windows instances can be added either by creating a `MachineSet`, or by specifying existing instances through a `ConfigMap`. The operator will do all the necessary steps to configure the instance so that it can join the cluster as a worker node.

Follow the steps below to install the operator:
1. Navigate to **Operators** > **OperatorHub** in the left menu.
2. Search for `Windows`.
3. Click on **Windows Machine Config Operator** provided by Red Hat and click **Install**.
4. Leave all settings as the default and click **Install** once more.

> Note: The operator installation may take several minutes to complete. Wait for the status of `succeeded` before continuing with the following step.

## 2.3 - Create configuration secrets

The windows machine config operator expects a secret to be present in its namespace called `cloud-private-key` containing a private key. This private key will be used to log into the soon to be provisioned Windows machine and set it up as an OpenShift node.

Run the commands below to connect to your environment bastion host and create the required secret.

1. Enter `ssh lab-user@<bastion-hostname>` replacing `<bastion-hostname>` with the one listed in your **Bastion Access** environment details page.
2. Enter the password mentioned under **Bastion Access** in your environment details page.
3. Generate a new ssh key with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ${HOME}/.ssh/winkey -q -N ''`
4. Run the command below to create the required secret from the public key you just created.

```bash
oc create secret generic cloud-private-key --from-file=private-key.pem=${HOME}/.ssh/winkey -n openshift-windows-machine-config-operator
```
