Red Hat [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a unified platform to build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale. In this first excercise we'll get logged into our cluster and familarise ourselves with the OpenShift web console and web terminal.

The OpenShift Container Platform web console is a feature-rich web console with both an Administrator perspective and a Developer perspective accessible through any modern web browser. You can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage your OpenShift cluster and the applications running on it.

In addition to the web console, OpenShift includes command line tools to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the platform. The `oc` command line tool is available for Linux, macOS or Windows.

**Let's get started!**

## 1.1 - Login to lab environment

An OpenShift `4.14` cluster has already been provisioned for you to complete these excercises. Open your web browser and navigate to the workshop login page https://demo.redhat.com/workshop/vq5abz.

Once the page loads you can login with the details provided by your workshop facilitator.

## 1.2 - Login to the cluster web console

Once you're logged into the lab environnment we can open up the OpenShift web console and login with the credentials provided. 

When first logging in you will be prompted to take a tour of the **Developer** console view, let's do that now.

## 1.3 - Understanding projects

Projects are a logical boundary to help you organize your applications. An OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a single user) to organize and manage their work in isolation from other projects. 

Each project has its own resources, role based access control (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc). 

Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services you (or your teams) are using for your work.

In this lab environment, you already have access to single project: `userX` (Where X is the number of your user allocted for the workshop.)

Let's click into our `Project` from the left hand panel of the "Developer" web console view. We should be able to see that our project has no `Deployments` and there are no compute cpu or memory resources currently being consumed.

## 1.4 - Switching between perspectives

Different roles have different needs when it comes to viewing details within the OpenShift web console. At the top of the left navigation menu, you can toggle between the Administrator perspective and the Developer perspective.

Select **Administrator** to switch to the Administrator perspective. 

Once the Administrator perspective loads, you should be in the "Home" view and see a wider array of menu sections in the left hand navigation panel.

Switch back to the **Developer** perspective. Once the Developer perspective loads, select the **Topology** view.

Right now, there are no applications or components to view in your `userX`  project, but once you begin working on the lab, youâ€™ll be able to visualize and interact with the components in your application here.

## 1.5 - Launching a web terminal

While web interfaces are comfortable and easy to use, sometimes we want to quickly run commands to get things done. That is where the `oc` command line utility comes in.

One handy feature of the OpenShift web console is we can launch a web terminal that will create a browser based terminal that already has the `oc` command logged in and ready to use.

Let's launch a web terminal now by clicking the terminal button in the top right hand corner and then clicking **Start** with our `userX` project selected.
