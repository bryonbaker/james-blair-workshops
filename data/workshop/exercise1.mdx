Welcome to the OpenShift Windows Containers Workshop! Here you'll have a chance to build your windows container prowess.  

With a Red Hat subscription, you can get support for running Windows workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.

For this workshop you'll be given a fresh OpenShift 4 cluster which currently only runs linux containers. You will complete a series of exercises to transform the cluster to be capable to run Windows containers.

**Let's get started!**

To get underway open your web browser and navigate to the following link to reserve yourself a user https://demo.redhat.com/workshop/98b7pu.  You can reserve an environment by entering any email address along with the password provided by your workshop facilitator.
