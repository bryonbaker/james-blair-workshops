summary: "Will OpenShift Virtualisation live migrate a virtual machine?"
---

During the demo with the Acme Financial Services team one of their traditional hypervisor team asked if you can show them a live migration for a running virtual machine.

Thinking on your feet you remember the Fedora virtual machine you've were tinkering with last night in the `demotestblah17` namespace on the cluster.

The Acme Financial Services team have put you on the spot, can you quickly pull off a virtual machine live migration? ðŸ˜…


## 3.1 - Initiate the live migration

...

## 3.2 - Confirm the workload is uninterrupted

...

## 3.3 - Check your work

If the virtual machine in your **demotestblah17** namespace has been live migrated successfully please post a message in `#event-anz-ocp-virt-hackathon` with the message:

> Please review team [name] solution for exercise 3.

This exercise is worth 25 points. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total score.
