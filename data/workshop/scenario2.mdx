summary: "Will OpenShift Virtualisation run Acme virtual machines?"

They are concerned a modern cloud native virtualisation platform like OpenShift Virtualistion won't support running their **Crusty Corp Financial Applianceâ„¢** vm appliances which run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 and cannot be updated or altered in any way.

The deal rests on your teams ability to prove that an old operating system will boot successfully within OpenShift Virtualisation.
